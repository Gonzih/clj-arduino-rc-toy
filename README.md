![RC Toy Arduino Clojure](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4109351/for-posts/rc-toy/rc-toy-1.jpg)

A Clojure project for controlling Arduino based toy using Clodiuno and Bluetooth with Gamepad.

Most of JInput related code was taken from really great [jinput-overtone](https://github.com/gavilancomun/jinput-overtone) library.

Maybe one day I will extract input logic to separated library.

## Usage

* use rfcomm to bind bluetooth as searial port
* baudrate is 9600
* `./run.sh`
